# Grandma's Recipes
I recently found my great-grandma's old recipe box and decided to start digitizing them. I've done minimal editing on the contents of the recipes and have not cooked them, but I thought the internet may appreciate them.

Although the primary goal is to catalog my family recipes, I willing to recieve contributions.

It is my understanding that recipes cannot be copyright protected, and even if they could, I would not wish to do so. As such, the recipes are public domain.
